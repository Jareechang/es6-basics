# Generators

My review notes from 2ality blog about es6 [generators](http://www.2ality.com/2015/03/es6-generators.html).

##### What are generators ?

generators are functions that can be paused and resumed. 

Two important applications of generators are:

• Implementing iterables 
• Blocking Asynchronous function calls
    - The execution would wait until results is ready, meaning that the code would look synchronous while performing asynchronous operations
